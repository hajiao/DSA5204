# DSA5204
In the DSA5204 Project test.ipynb file, we develop our own algorithm instead of importing from packages and verify 
the blocks with similar ones in keras.cv. The performance of the project is evaluated by measuring the computational 
speed, as documented in the DSA5204 Project.ipynb file. The DSA5204project utils.py file trains the model using the 
server GPU and stores the resulting training data in the log data.npy file. The automl.ipynb file outlines the structure of diverse 
training models, including associated modules and utilized functions. The unbalance_data.py file contains codes used for extending the paper.
The Progressive Learning Plotting.ipynb file trains the model using an unbalanced dataset, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the 
results. Additionally, there is a Progressive Learning Plotting.ipynb dedicated to visualizing the training data outcomes stored 
in the log_data.npy file.
